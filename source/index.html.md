## Signature Authentication & Verification

### Signature Illustration

Considering that API requests may get tampered in the process of transmission, to keep the transmission secure, you have to use your API Key to do Signature Authentication for all private interface except for public interface (used for acuqiring basic information and market data), in this way to verify whether the parameters/ parameter value get tampered or not in the process of transmission

A legitimate request consists of following parts：

- Request address of method, i.e. visit server address--api.hbdm.com, e.g.:  api.hbdm.com/api/v1/contract_order

- API Access Key ID (AccessKeyId): Access Key of the API Key that you apply.

- Method of Signature (SignatureMethod): Based on the Hash Aggrement, users calculate the signature via HmacSHA256.

- aSignature Version (SignatureVersion): It adopts version 2 in terms of Signature Version.

- Timestamp (Timestamp): The time when you send the request (UTC time zone) : (UTC time zone) : (UTC time zone), e.g.: 2017-05-11T16:22:06

- Must-fill parameters & optional parameters: For each method, there are a group of must-fill parameters and optional parameters used to address the API request, which can be found in the illustration of each method as well as their meaning. Please note that, in terms of "Get" requests, it needs to do Signature calculation for all the original parameters in each method ; In terms of "Post" requests, no need to do Signature calculation for the original parameters in each method, which means only four parameters need to do Signature calculation in "Post" requests, i.e. AccessKeyId, SignatureMethod, SignatureVersion, Timestamp with other parameters placed in "body".

- Signature: The result of Signature calculation which is used to verify if signature is valid and not tampered.


### Create API Key

<a href='https://www.hbg.com/zh-cn/apikey/'>You could  create API Key at</a>

API Key consists of the following two parts.

- "Access Key", the Key used to visit API.
  
- "Secret Key", the Key used to do Signature authentication and verification (visible during application period).

<aside class="notice">
When create API Key, users could bind IP address, as the validity of unbond IP address is only 90 days.
</aside>
<aside class="notice">
API Key has operation authorization of trading, borrowing, deposit and withdrawal etc..
</aside>
<aside class="warning">
Both Access Key and Secret Key are closely related with account security, please do not disclose them to others for any reasons anytime.
</aside>


### Steps for Signature

Normative request for Signature calculation     Different contents will get totally different results when use HMAC to calculate Signature, therefore, please normalize the requests before doing Signature calculation. Take the request of inquering order details as an example:

query details of one order 

`https://api.hbdm.com/api/v1/contract_order?`

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`&SignatureVersion=2`

`&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15:19:30`

`&symbol=BTC`

#### 1. Request methods (GET/POST): add line breaker "\n".


`GET\n`

#### 2. Text the visit address in lowercase, adding line breake "\n"

`
api.hbdm.com\n
`

#### 3. Visit the path of methods, adding line breaker "\n"

`
/api/v1/contract_order\n
`

#### 4. Rank the parameter names according to the sequence of ASCII codes, for example, below is the parameters in original sequence and the new sequence:


`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`symbol=BTC`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

<aside class="notice">
Use UTF-8 to encode when it has already been encoded by URI with hexadecimals in Uppercase, e.g., ":" wiil be encoded to "%3A" while space to "%20".
</aside>
<aside class="notice">
Timestamp should be written in the form of YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss and encoded with URI.
</aside>


#### 5. After ranking

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

`symbol=BTC`

#### 6.  Following the sequence above, link parameters with "&"


`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30&symbol=BTC`

#### 7. Form the final character strings that need to do Signature calculation as following:

`GET\n`

`api.hbdm.com\n`

`/api/v1/contract_order\n`

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30&symbol=BTC`


#### 8. Use the "request character strings" formed in the last step and your Secret Key to create a digital Signature.

`4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp+B4w+ivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o=`

1. Take the request character string formed in the last step and API Secret Key as two parameters, encoding them with the Hash Function HmacSHA256 to get corresponding Hash value.

2. Encoding the Hash value with base-64 code, the result will be the digital Signature of this request.

#### 9. Add the digital Signature into the parameters of request path.

The final request sent to Server via API should be like:

`https://api.hbdm.com/api/v1/contract_order?AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&order-id=1234567890&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30&Signature=4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp%2BB4w%2BivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o%3D`

1. Add all the must authentication parameters into the parameters of request path;

2. Add the digital Signature encoded with URL code into the path parameters with the parameter name of "Signature".

## API Rate Limit Illustration

Please note that, for both public interface and private interface, there are rate limits, more details are as below:
* Generally, the private interface rate limit of API key is at most 30 times every 3 second for each UID (this 30 times every 3 second rate limit is shared by all the altcoins contracts delivered by different date).
* For public interface used to get information of index, price limit, settlement, delivery, open positions and so on, the rate limit is 60 times every 3 second at most for each IP (this 60 times every 3 second public interface rate limit is shared by all the requests from that IP of non-marketing information, like above).
* In terms of public interface used to get candle chart data, the latest transaction record and information of aggregate market, order book and so on, the rate limit is as below:

    （1） For restful interface: 200 times/second for one IP at most.

    （2）For websocket: The rate limit for “req” request is 50 times at once. No limit for “sub” request as the data will be pushed by sever voluntarily.

* WebSoket, the private order push interface, requires API KEY Verification:

    Each UID can build at most create 10 WS connections for private order push at the same time. For each account, 
    contracts of the same underlying coin only need to subscribe one WS order push, e.g. users only need to create one WS 
    order push connection for BTC Contract which will automatically push orders of BTC weekly, BTC biweekly and BTC quarterly
    contracts. Please note that the rate limit of WS order push and RESTFUL private interface are separated from each other, with no relations.

* Will response following string for "header" via api 

    ratelimit-limit: the upper limit of requests per time, unit: time

    ratelimit-interval: reset interval (reset the number of request), unit: ms

    ratelimit-remaining: the left available request number for this round, unit: time

    ratelimit-reset: upper limit of reset time used to reset request number, unit: ms
